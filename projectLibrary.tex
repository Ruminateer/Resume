    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm and an exact algorithm for the travelling salesman problem using C++.
        \item
        Implemented Prim's MST algorithm.
        % Applied branch and bound for the exact algorithm:
        % Use the output of the heuristic algorithm as the initial upper bound.
        In the exact algorithm, used the algorithm to search for the MST that spans the unvisited points to estimate the cost of the current branch. Prune the current branch if the estimation exceeds the minimal cost so far.

    \poswithprd{Course Project: SillyQL}{Nov 2018}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Implemented a relational database using C++, which supports operations on entries that meet user-specified conditions. 
        % The conditions can be a range of values on any attribution.
        \item
        Let the database generate hash tables as index on demand to speed up searching.

    \poswithprd{Course Project: LC2K ISA}{Sept 2018-Dec 2018}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Implemented an assembler and a linker for LC2K ISA using C.
        \item
        Implemented a simulator for LC2K ISA using C.
        The simulator simulates a machine with a 5-stage detect\&forward pipeline and user-specified cache configuration.

    \poswithprd{HACKxSJTU}{June 2018}
    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item
        Designed an AR navigation application, which places pets at crossings to indicate  directions.
        \item
        Used Unity and ARCore to implement the application on Android devices. Used C\# to control the motion of the pets.

    \begin{miniItemize}
        % TODO: organize the words better
        \item
        Worked in a team of 8 members. The team designed and implemented a robot to catch and transport various objects. 
        Won championship.
        \item 
        Designed the frame of the robot. 
        Communicated with all the members to make sure that everyone's part fit in the frame.

        \item 
        Led a group of 4 members. The group designed and implemented a parking lot system using C++, and visualized a parking lot using OpenGL.
        \item Designed the interfaces of all the classes. Implemented all the base classes.

    \begin{miniItemize}
        \item   
        Designed a robotic car, which could run along the track, start and stop under conditions specified by the rules.
        \item
        Designed a tower, which used distance sensors to locate the robotic cars and used a LASER to shoot the cars.
        \item 
        Implemented the car and the tower, using Arduino as the control unit.
