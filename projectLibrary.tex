            Designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm and an exact algorithm for the travelling salesman problem using C++.
            \item
            Applied branch and bound for the exact algorithm:
            Use the output of the heuristic algorithm as the initial upper bound.
            Search for the minimum tree that spans the unvisited points to estimate the cost of the current branch.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item
            Implemented an assembler and a linker for LC2K ISA using C.
            \item
            Implemented a simulator for LC2K ISA using C.
            The simulator simulates a machine with a 5 stage pipeline and user-specified cache configuration.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item
            Designed an AR navigation application, which could place pets at crossings to indicate  directions.
            \item
            Used Unity and ARCore to implement the application on Android devices. Used C\# to control the motion of the pets.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item
            Designed and implemented a robot to catch and transport various objects.
            Won championship.

            Designed a robotic car, which could run along the track, start and stop under conditions specified by the rules.
            \item
            Designed a tower, which used distance sensors to locate the robotic cars and used a LASER to shoot the cars.
            \item 
            Implemented the car and the tower, using Arduino as the control unit.
