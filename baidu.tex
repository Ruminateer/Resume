Developed various components for running Paddle workflows on Kubernetes.

\begin{miniItemize}
    \item Added Paddle predictor to \href{https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving}{KFServing}, allowing users to serve Paddle models on Kubernetes.
    \begin{itemize}[after=\vspace{0ex}]
        \item Used KFServing Python SDK and Paddle inference to develop Paddle Server, an HTTP server that serves Paddle models. Added GitHub workflows for building and publishing Paddle Server docker image.
        \item Added Paddle predictor support to KFServing inferenceservice CRD and controller. Provided with only the location of Paddle models in the object spec, the controller can setup a directly usable autoscaled inference service using the Paddle Server image.

    \item Developed \href{https://github.com/PaddleFlow/paddle-operator}{Paddle Operator}, allowing users to train Paddle models on Kubernetes.
    \begin{itemize}[after=\vspace{0ex}]
        \item Upgraded the legacy operator. Migrated the project from Go Dep to Go Modules. Upgraded the dependencies so that the operator works on Kubernetes 1.20. Wrote design docs.
        \item Created helm charts to simplify operator deployment. Wrote controller tests.
